# Tips for Responding to Reviewers
Here are a few tips and resources for responding to reviewers. 

## First Steps
When you receive the reviewer comments, create a google doc containing all the reviews. In another color text, list your plans to address each point and any notes such as which might be challenging.

## General Advice
1. Focus on responding directly and succinctly to reviewer comments. Avoid making unprompted changes or addressing issues that were not raised in the reviews (unless they're really important errors). Assume the reviewer will have limited energy to spend on reading your response, so make your points clearly and quickly. 

2. When a reviewer response involves referring to something in the manuscript, use page/line numbers to make the reference easy to find. Or, even better, copy the relevant lines/ figures into the response to reviewer file. (Some journals require the response to reviewer file to be text-only, so make sure this is permitted). *If you do this, make sure the copied line matches the manuscript exactly, even as you continue making edits to one or the other*

3. It's okay to disagree with some reviewer comments, or not to go with their recommendations. If you (and Alexis/ collaborators) decide to do so, defend your reasoning clearly and politely. That said, be careful in how you choose your battles. If it's something you can feasibly do without significantly decreasing the quality of the paper, do it.

## Style/ Tone
This [APA Guide to Reviewer Response](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/research-publication/response-reviewers) is helpful and provides an example of how to respond to reviewer comments. In particular, be direct in saying nice things to the reviewer, like starting responses with "We thank the reviewer for this suggestion" or "This is an important point". Acknowledge the high-level summaries that often start a reviewer response with a comment like "Thank you for the kind comments on our work". (See the example document for more examples of how to do this). 

## Avoiding Formatting Nightmares
Be mindful that as you modify your manuscript, the order of supplementary figures may change, as well as line numbers. For supplementary figures, it can be a good idea to swap out figure numbers (i.e. S1) for descriptions (i.e. S_paga) while editing, until you are ready to submit the revised manuscript and all figures are in final order. In particular, if you use underscores, it will be easier to search for figure references that have not yet been updated. You can also highlight figure references and line numbers in a distinct color in your response to reviewer file, so you don't forget to go back and change them when you are ready to submit the revised manuscript.
